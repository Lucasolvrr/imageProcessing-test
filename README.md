**Image Processing**
This is an image processing project that performs certain operations on digital images. The code is written in Python and uses various popular image processing libraries.

Functionality
The project is divided into several Python scripts, each performing a specific function in image processing. Here are the main scripts and their functions:

preprocessing.py: This script is responsible for preprocessing the images before applying specific processing operations.

segmentation.py: This script executes image segmentation algorithms to separate regions of interest.

filtering.py: This script applies filters and smoothing or enhancement operations to the images.

analysis.py: This script performs statistical or pattern analyses on the processed images.

**Installation**
To run the code in this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries manually or using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file. To install the libraries manually, execute the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
If you prefer to use a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file, follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda.

Activate the virtual environment.

In the project directory, create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:

Copy code
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
Execute the following command in the terminal to install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
With the libraries installed, you will be ready to execute the image processing scripts in this project.

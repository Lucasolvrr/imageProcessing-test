# Image Processing

This is an image processing project that performs certain operations on digital images. The code is written in Python and uses various popular image processing libraries.


## Installation

To run the code in this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries manually or using a virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` file. To install the libraries manually, execute the following command in the terminal:

```pip install numpy```
```pip install opencv-python```
```pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib```

If you prefer to use a virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `conda`.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. In the project directory, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib


4. Execute the following command in the terminal to install the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
